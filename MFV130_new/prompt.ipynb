    "Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) groups moral intuitions into foundations. We focus on the Fairness/Cheating foundation, which centers on justice, equity, and reciprocity. This foundation reflects sensitivity to people gaining undeserved advantages, cheating, or exploiting others for personal benefit. To isolate the fairness domain, avoid scenarios involving loyalty to in-groups, defiance of authority, or structural inequities based on race, gender, or class. The goal is to depict morally salient but realistic situations of cheating, deception, or rule-bending that violate principles of fairness in everyday life.\n",

    "Generate 350 new one-sentence items for the Fairness foundation. Each item must describe a person gaining unfair benefit, breaking rules, or exploiting others for self-interest in everyday, plausible settings (e.g., school, workplace, sports, public interactions).

    "\n",
    "BACKGROUND (for context)\n",
    "Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) identifies Liberty/Oppression as a moral foundation concerned with resistance to domination and protection of individual autonomy. This foundation focuses on discomfort with unjust control, coercion, or restriction of personal freedom by those in positions of authority or influence.  \n",
    "Liberty violations occur when someone uses power or social pressure to override another person’s free will—limiting their choices, identity, expression, or movement. These acts often come from parents, bosses, spouses, political or religious figures, or peers exerting coercive influence. The moral concern arises from suppression of autonomy, not from harm, betrayal, or disrespect.\n",
    "\n",
    "OBJECTIVE\n",
    "Generate 350 new one-sentence items for the Liberty foundation. Each item should describe a scenario where an individual or institution restricts another person’s autonomy, forces conformity, or limits personal freedom of choice. The act should feel coercive, domineering, or unjust, but realistic and situated in everyday life contexts such as family, work, school, or civic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "STYLE & FORMAT TO FOLLOW (copy tone/structure from these examples; do NOT copy content)\n",
    "Examples (Liberty):\n",
    "You see a man telling his fiancée that she has to switch to his political party.\n",
    "You see a father requiring his son to become a commercial airline pilot like him.\n",

    "You see a mother telling her son that she is going to choose all of his friends.\n",
    "You see a boss ordering an employee to revoke his citizenship in his home country.\n",
    "You see a woman pressuring her daughter to become a famous evening news anchor.\n",
    "You see a mayor trying to ban people from hugging and kissing in public in his city.\n",
    "You see a pastor banning his congregants from wearing bright colors in the church.\n",
