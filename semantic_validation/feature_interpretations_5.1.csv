layer16_fid122008,Reporting rising rates and worsening statistics,"This feature activates on expository passages that describe increasing prevalence, severity, or spread of problems using quantitative or comparative statistics (e.g., higher rates, more cases, worsening conditions over time). The text typically highlights trends like doubling, record highs, or dramatic increases in disease, environmental damage, or social issues, often framed as especially severe or unprecedented.",none,none,"Many snippets emphasize growth or worsening over time with numerical or superlative framing: “by far the worst such event since the phenomenon was first identified” and “levels…approaching zero” for oxygen loss [0]; “extremly high levels…almost five times the treshold” and worst health effects in India [1]; “high numbers reflect a true increase” in COVID-19 infections with rising hospitalizations and deaths [2]; drought area “more than doubled” and severe drought up “more than 400 percent” [3]; obesity rates where many states now exceed thresholds that none did previously [8]; methane and manure quantities contributing to warming with each year “getting hotter” [9]; tick infection rates “higher than expected” [10]; and infection “exacerbated…earlier onset, accelerated progression, and enhanced severity” in a disease model [11].

layer28_fid106785,Word-game anagram and Scrabble list formatting,"This feature activates on structured word-game content, especially pages listing anagrams and Scrabble words derivable from a given word, often with headings for word lengths and boilerplate about Scrabble trademarks or wildcard letters. It also appears with similar list-like, rule-based educational or assessment formats such as rubrics and stepwise math explanations.",none,none,"Many snippets are from Scrabble/anagram helper pages that repeat a fixed template: “All anagrams that could be made from letters of word X plus a … Scrabble words that can be created with letters from word X … 10 letter words … 2 letter words … SCRABBLE is the registered trademark … we merely provide help” [4][5][6][9][10]. These share a strong structural and topical pattern around word games and letter permutations. Related evidence includes other highly structured educational or evaluative formats, like an essay rubric with trait scales [7] and a stepwise system-of-equations/least-squares explanation [8], which match the same procedural, list-oriented style. The remaining snippets do not suggest a coherent moral or authority-related theme, so no MFT category is appropriate.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]",0.86
layer16_fid10095,Planning and designing structured programs or courses,"This feature activates for texts that describe planning, designing, or structuring formal programs or courses—such as training, educational curricula, transitional programs, or policy frameworks—often outlining steps, stakeholders, goals, and methods. The emphasis is on organized, systematic approaches to achieving objectives in institutional or organizational contexts.",authority,virtue,"Many snippets discuss creating or improving structured programs within institutions, implying respect for organized processes and expert or institutional guidance. Examples include defining projects to meet organizational goals [0], establishing governmental authority and frameworks for crisis management [1], outlining stages of the writing process for classroom teaching [2], collaborative decision-making for school ICT integration [3], building transitional programs for students with disabilities with guidance for parents, teachers, and administrators [4], planning soft skills training [5], designing engagement/education programs for patients [6], focusing on foundational aspects of poverty alleviation programs [7], assessing training needs before conducting training programs in organizations [8], optimizing antibiotic use through policy and practical planning [9], and instructional strategies in character education courses [10].

layer16_fid66424,Epidemiological risk rates and health statistics,"This feature activates on quantitative epidemiological reporting, especially percentages, incidence or mortality rates, and comparative risk statistics in public health or medical contexts. The snippets typically describe population-level health outcomes, case-fatality rates, or behavior-related health risks using formal statistical language.",none,none,"Many snippets present health-related statistics such as increased risk of death, case-fatality rates, incidence estimates, and comparative outcome percentages in clinical trials or population studies [0][1][2][3][4][8][9][10][11]. Others similarly discuss quantified health or hygiene risks (infection spread, diet-related disease, bone loss) in a scientific or public health framing [5][7][9][10]. The common pattern is not moral evaluation but formal, numerical description of health risks and outcomes at the population level, so no specific Moral Foundations category applies.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.9
layer20_fid46113,Section headings and bullet-pointed list structure,"This feature activates on texts organized into explicit sections, headings, or bullet-pointed lists that enumerate attributes, chapters, or data fields in a structured way. It is sensitive to catalog-style formatting such as titled sections followed by dash- or bullet-led items describing properties or contents.",none,none,"Many snippets show clear section or chapter titles followed by organized subitems or bullet points. Example [0] lists title-page components and chapter headings; [1] is a structured attribute list for plants with repeated dash-prefixed fields; [2] begins with a software title and release info in a structured header; [5] and [8] have labeled sections like “Our Brewery and Process” or “Location:” followed by descriptive fields; [6] lists labeled Olympic host data; [10] and [11] are scientific/medical abstracts with clearly demarcated aims or symptom/treatment descriptions. The commonality is document-style structural metadata and enumerated properties, not any moral content.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8]",0.86
layer4_fid8682,Q&A advice column answer responses,"This feature activates on answer segments in advice or Q&A columns, where an expert responds directly to a reader’s question, often beginning with an address or explanation and providing guidance or clarification. The style is explanatory, authoritative, and supportive, frequently following a quoted question with an “A:” section that elaborates on causes, context, and recommended actions.",authority,virtue,"Many snippets are clearly from advice or expert Q&A formats, with an 'A:' introducing an authoritative response to a prior question. The responder adopts an expert, guiding tone: explaining research or diagnostic criteria [1], advising a parent on educational focus for a gifted child [2], diagnosing plant or lawn problems and suggesting what to do [3],[7], giving medical/vaccine explanations and recommendations [4], interpreting child cheating behavior developmentally and advising on parenting [5], clarifying evolving language norms around marriage [6], explaining usage history of phrases [8], confirming and elaborating on carbohydrate counting guidelines [9], distinguishing obedience from sociability and advising on dog behavior [10], and validating a mother’s concern while referencing clinical experience [11].

layer20_fid68970,"Citations, credentials, and institutional attributions","This feature activates on text that attributes information to authoritative sources, including named experts with credentials, formal organizations, historical institutions, and cited publications or exhibitions. It often appears in bylines, reference lists, institutional descriptions, and explanatory notes that establish provenance or authority for the surrounding content.",authority,virtue,"Many snippets explicitly foreground institutional or expert authority: a named medical doctor with board certification and training is presented as the source of information [0]; formal organizational references and URLs are listed as sources (American Heart Association, FDA) in a citation-style format [1]; an imperial abbey is described with its official status and historical titles within the Holy Roman Empire [2]; a press release is attributed to GAVI and quotes the UN Secretary-General, emphasizing institutional backing [3]; curriculum guidance is framed as coming from an official national curriculum and treaty principles [4]; a quotation is contextualized with the historical identity and moral stance (abolitionist) of a notable figure [5]; scientific research is attributed to a specific journal issue and a national study [6]; a scientific field’s history is narrated around a group of scientists at an annual meeting [7]; a language-learning site explains the formal second-person pronoun usage, invoking grammatical authority [8]; an art exhibition is described in terms of Renaissance artists’ engagement with the classical heritage and a curated institutional display [11].

layer28_fid17489,Formal informational / reference-style exposition,"This feature activates on formal, expository text that presents factual or instructional information in a structured, reference-like style, often including classifications, statuses, measurements, or academic/course details. The snippets typically describe entities or systems in a neutral, technical tone (e.g., species diagnoses, endangered status listings, course requirements, physical dimensions, or scientific explanations).",none,none,"Many snippets are neutral, technical descriptions: academic course descriptions and requirements [0][4], formal rulebook language for sports officiating [1], taxonomic diagnosis of a species [2], conservation status listings with standardized ranks [3], technical/academic discussion of systems thinking and economics [5], a reference-style description of a greenhouse from a gardening manual [6], a mission description for a lunar spacecraft and relay satellite [7], a museum-style description of a Viking warship [9], a tabular physical description of a reservoir [10], and a technical astrophysical explanation of resonances and orbits [11]. Even [8], which is more value-laden, is formatted as a formal school program description.

layer4_fid50293,Formal expository and academic-style writing,"This feature activates on formal, expository prose such as research abstracts, instructional or reference text, structured essays, and survey-based business analysis. The snippets share an informative, academic or semi-academic tone with organized presentation of facts, definitions, or arguments rather than narrative or casual conversation.",none,none,"Most snippets are written in a formal, informational style: a scientific study abstract about soil and metals [0], a structured plant reference entry [1], a technical man-page–like description of a Linux command [3], an assignment/contest prompt for a formal essay on freedom [4], instructions and thesis discussion for writing about Shakespearean sonnets [5], a table-of-contents style breakdown of a historical/geographical text [6], a public-health expository piece on tobacco use in Guam [7], a philosophical-popular science exposition on life extension [8], an art-criticism style museum description [9], a business/finance explanation of mergers and acquisitions with survey data [10], and a travel-themed but still essayistic, descriptive magazine-style piece [11].

layer20_fid6127,Introductory background and definitional openings,"This feature activates on passages that introduce a topic or entity with concise background information, often defining what it is, its role, or its historical/biographical context before elaborating further. The snippets commonly start sections or articles by situating the reader with basic facts, dates, or explanations of a concept or person.",none,none,"Several snippets clearly function as introductory background: defining inflammation and why it occurs [1], giving basic production and usage facts about Zea mays [2], introducing a state mapping task force and its process [3], opening a theological discussion by situating a biblical passage and its author [6], and providing a brief biographical introduction to Eusebius of Laodicea with role and dates [7]. Others similarly open with contextual framing, such as the BMJ review of COVID-19 antibody tests [5], the setup of a personal narrative about a mother in Burundi [8], the introduction of Greta Thunberg and her influence on the art world [9], and the description of a child’s history of Scotland book and its scope [10]. These all share the rhetorical function of orienting the reader with core identifying information at the start of a section or article, rather than expressing a specific moral stance.","[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]",0.79
layer28_fid106396,Introductory definitional or contextual statements,"This feature activates on sentences that introduce or define a topic, person, place, or process in an expository way, often serving as the opening contextual statement of a paragraph or article. These snippets typically state what something is, its role or importance, or that a particular treatment, series, or process exists, before elaborating further.",none,none,"Many snippets are clear introductory or definitional sentences: defining an art movement and its significance [2], introducing a national anthem and basic country facts [4], opening a human-interest story with generational context [5], marking the transition to the data analysis phase [6], explaining what lye originally referred to and how it is used [7], introducing a new treatment and its publication context [8], defining vitamin B complex and its components [9], describing a training series and its purpose [10], and broadly introducing light therapy and its general benefits [11]. These all function as initial, high-level context-setting statements rather than detailed explanations or arguments. The taxonomic and biographical snippets [0],[1] also begin with naming and basic identifying information, consistent with this pattern. There is no consistent moral or evaluative content, so no Moral Foundations category is appropriate.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]",0.86
layer28_fid23895,"Section titles, headings, and labeled list items","This feature activates on structured document elements such as section or chapter titles, labeled list items, and short heading-like phrases that introduce or categorize content (e.g., “Title Pages,” “Tree or Plant Type,” “Host City,” “Date Started”). It reflects the rhetorical function of organizing or labeling information rather than narrative prose.",none,none,"Many snippets begin with or prominently feature short, capitalized or colon-terminated labels that function as headings or field names: “Title Pages – Editor's Introduction – A Note on the Text…” [0], “All Common Names: Tree or Plant Type: – Deciduous…” [1], “Host City: London, Great Britain / Date Started: July 29, 1948 / Date Finished: August 14, 1948 / Participants: …” [5], and “Our Brewery and Process How Ohio Craft Beer Is Made / See Our Beers / Process, Descriptions and Ingredients in our beers” [10]. Even in more narrative contexts, there are clear titled sections like “Mutidetector Computed Tomography and its Uses In Radiological Imaging” [9] and “The Garden Museum explores the woodland paintings of Ivon Hitchens” [11]. These patterns indicate the feature is tied to structural headings and labeled list fields, not to moral content.","[0, 1, 5, 9, 10, 11]",0.86
layer24_fid59895,"Numbered sections, lists, and question items","This feature activates on structured, numbered formatting such as section headings, list items, question numbering, and labeled subsections (e.g., 2.1.4, 3 X 4 points, numbered examples). It reflects recognition of formal document or exercise structure rather than any particular topic or moral stance.",none,none,"Many snippets show hierarchical section numbering and list notation: academic or report-style subsections like “2.1.4”, “2.2.1”, “2.4.1” etc. [0], point allocations and numbered questions like “X 9 points), 3 questions from Brian (3 X 4 points)” [1], and numbered equations or sequences such as “an = 4n – 3…….1” and “a17 and a24” [9]. There are also repeated date and volume/issue formats that follow similar numeric-structural patterns [3][8][11].

Of course in reality… So what exactly is dust comprised of…” [10]. Others similarly introduce and describe a topic in an informational tone, such as the Amur tiger’s status [4], Baloch love for homeland in a cultural-historical frame [5], the history of a city block and its foundry [7], and an overview of U.S. history and the flag’s evolution [11]. These are all neutral, explanatory uses rather than moral evaluations, so no specific moral foundation applies.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]",0.86
layer16_fid42641,Explanatory or definitional introductory sentences,"This feature activates on opening sentences or brief passages that introduce and define a topic, event, place, or concept in an expository, reference-style manner. The text typically presents what something is, its purpose, or contextual basics before further detail, as in encyclopedia entries, legal definitions, or informational guides.",none,none,"Many snippets are clearly the first, framing sentence of an expository piece that defines or introduces a subject: a philosophical question about living forever [0], an annual student essay event and its sponsor [1], a bridge and its location and significance [2], a disease and a song about its spread and control [3], a yachting crew and their scientific mission [4], a historic district and its boundaries [5], a legal term and its purpose in court [6], an article about foods to avoid for glucose balance [7], a Linux command implementation and its basis [8], a kids’ book and its subject matter [9], a sport and its origin and rules [10], and a medical discovery and Nobel recognition [11].

layer24_fid17839,Assessing or rating condition or quality,"This feature activates on language that evaluates the condition, quality, or state of something (health, environment, objects, systems) using explicit ratings or qualitative labels such as excellent, good, poor, desirable, or in relatively poor condition. It often appears in technical, scientific, or official assessments that classify status or performance levels.",none,none,"Multiple snippets explicitly describe graded conditions or states: health or physical condition rated on a scale with terms like excellent and poor [1], ecological or environmental systems rated as in relatively poor condition or given comparative ratings [2],[5], objects described as in good to fair condition [3], and system states evaluated as desirable or undesirable [9]. These all share the semantic pattern of assessing and labeling the condition or quality of something, often in a formal or technical context.

layer24_fid90226,Definitions and hierarchies of roles and positions,"This feature activates on text that defines, explains, or contrasts formal roles, titles, and positions within organizations or structured systems, often including their place in a hierarchy and associated responsibilities or competencies. It spans corporate, academic, governmental, technical, and online community contexts where roles are categorized, ranked, or distinguished from one another.",authority,virtue,"Many snippets explicitly describe formal positions and their rank within a structured hierarchy (executive vs team members, associate professor between ranks, city council titles, engineering grades) or delineate role-based authority and responsibilities (admins with special powers, housekeeper in charge of staff, Six Sigma belt levels, technician competency levels). These are classic expressions of social and organizational authority structures and role differentiation, aligning with the Authority foundation in its descriptive, order-maintaining sense rather than subversion or disrespect. Evidence includes hierarchical leadership and team roles [0], academic rank between assistant and full professor [1], distinction between clerical and executive positions [2], graded competency levels for technicians [3], Six Sigma belt hierarchy and roles [4], elected council roles and titles [5], responsibility over cleaning staff [6], generic vs skilled roles in a play and work context [7], advisory councils/boards and NEDs as governance roles [8], admins with special powers over a site [9], salary bands by grade for engineers [10], and business/management positions and HR manager role [11].","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.86

The snippets include explicit definitional phrasing and systematic explanation of terms or principles, such as probability, medical screening recommendations, and technical measures like Total Acid Number.",none,none,"Several snippets clearly define or explain concepts in a formal, didactic way. Snippet [4] explicitly begins with “Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with…”, a textbook-style definition. Snippet [5] is a labeled definition of TAN, including what it stands for and how it is measured. Snippet [1] systematically lists recommended screening tests with structured criteria, reflecting formal guideline-style exposition. Snippet [0] explains resilience theory and stable states in a structured, conceptual way. Snippet [3] explains expected gain in motor strategies using formal probabilistic language.

layer8_fid88589,Section headings and labeled list structures,"This feature activates on texts organized into explicit sections or bullet-style entries, where each line begins with a label or heading followed by a brief description or data point. It commonly appears in tables of contents, structured lists of attributes, event summaries, or process descriptions that use consistent heading–detail formatting.",none,none,"Many snippets are dominated by line-initial labels followed by short explanatory fragments, indicating a structural rather than semantic theme.

Others describe objectives and outcomes in structured, procedural contexts such as internships, food safety, test cases, and instructional design [4,5,6,10]. Additional snippets discuss requirements and rules for business documents and software behavior, reinforcing the theme of formalized requirements and compliance-oriented guidelines [2,11].

Others show assignment-style or essay-prompt framing like “Write an essay on the shakespeare sonnets / Thesis statement for shakespeares sonnets…” [5] and “all students … were asked to write an essay titled ‘What Freedom Means to Me.’ This annual event, sponsored by…” [8]. Even the religious and public-health texts begin with formal, declarative headings or mission-like statements (e.g., “DID JESUS OBSERVE THE PASSOVER? A.M.D.G.” [1]; “Guam is in the midst of an epidemic of tobacco use.” as a policy-style opener [3]). Across domains, the commonality is not topic or morality but the presence of formal, expository headings and organizational scaffolding.

It also fires on closely related word-list and word-formation explanations that enumerate possible derived words and their properties.",none,none,"Several snippets explicitly come from Scrabble or word-game contexts, giving dictionary-style definitions, letter breakdowns, and lists of anagrams or shorter words formed from a base word (e.g., filar, Suba, hairnet, KARATS, COMMATA, Tide). These share a consistent pattern: they name a word, state its acceptability in Scrabble/Word with Friends, list its letters, and enumerate anagrams or subwords.

It seems tied to meta-textual labeling of definitional background material rather than any specific topic domain.",none,none,"Multiple snippets contain the exact phrase or heading ‘Background information and definitions’ in formal, report-like prose, indicating the feature is keyed to that structural/section-label pattern rather than content: amphibian lighting guidance [0], fisheries offal management [10]. Other snippets also foreground ‘definitions’ or ‘lets start with some definitions’ in an expository way [5], consistent with a general pattern of labeled definitional/background sections. There is no clear moral or social-evaluative content, so no Moral Foundations category applies.","[0, 5, 10]",0.86
layer20_fid82758,"Section titles, headings, and labeled metadata","This feature activates on structured headings and labeled sections, such as chapter titles, list-style metadata fields, and formal document section headers. The text often consists of short noun phrases or labels followed by colons or dashes, organizing content into titled parts or attribute lists.",none,none,"Many snippets are dominated by explicit titles or section headers: book front matter and chapter titles [0], labeled attribute lists for plants [1], a study aim sentence that reads like a formal section opener [2], a news-style caption-like intro [3], a public health announcement header about an epidemic [4], a theological article title in all caps [5], a medical information section opener [6], structured event metadata for a host city and dates [7], a museum exhibition description beginning with the institution name and topic [8], a historic district designation header with boundaries and neighborhood labels [9], a press-release style heading about a yachting crew [10], and an educational unit title with sub-lesson headings [11].

It often appears in legal, religious, or policy contexts that define the boundaries of legitimate authority or regulation.",authority,virtue,"Several snippets describe authority or legal power as valid only within limits set by higher norms. The Catholic Catechism passage states that no one may command what is contrary to the dignity of persons and natural law, and that authority should express a just hierarchy of values (authority constrained by moral law) [1]. The criminology text on natural law explanations of criminality invokes behaviors that must be universally prohibited because they are morally repugnant or detrimental to normal order [6]. The geographical indications text excludes indications contrary to public order or morality from protection [9]. The Indonesian patent law snippet excludes inventions that are contrary to national laws and regulations from patentability [10]. The New Zealand human rights discussion focuses on laws being inconsistent with the human right to be free from discrimination and the power to declare such inconsistency [11]. Together these show a pattern of discussing when formal authority, law, or protection is invalidated by conflict with higher moral or legal standards, which aligns with the Authority foundation in its virtuous form (legitimate, norm-bounded authority).","[1, 6, 9, 10, 11]",0.86

layer8_fid127400,Tabular or list-style structured information,"This feature activates on text formatted as structured lists or tables, often using bullets, numbering, or column separators to present categorical or quantitative information (e.g., divisions, constituencies, troop counts, product features). It reflects a stylistic pattern of organizing data into labeled, often multi-column entries rather than continuous prose.",none,none,"Many snippets show table-like or list-like formatting with delimiters such as pipes, bullets, or numbered items: administrative divisions and statistics in a table layout [4], opposing army compositions and casualties in a battle table [6], product feature bullet lists and size labels [1], symbol and font feature lists [2], and enumerations of organization types [9]. Even when the content is narrative, it is organized into clearly separated branches or categories [7] or legal rule lists [8].

layer8_fid113454,Academic critique and critical evaluation writing,"This feature activates for academic or instructional text that discusses critically evaluating, analyzing, or reviewing theories, research, media, or literature, often using terms like “critique,” “critical review,” and “critically analyses.” It centers on the genre and process of scholarly critique, literature reviews, and analytical assessments of works or ideas rather than on their specific content.",none,none,"Across the snippets, the common thread is meta-level discussion of critique and critical evaluation in academic contexts. Several explicitly mention “critically evaluates” or “critically analyses” (e.g., geoengineering paper, Camus analysis) or “critical review” (Plato’s education theory) and “critique sources and triangulate” or “critique various language-teaching approaches” in learning outcomes. Others describe how to write literature reviews or media reviews, emphasizing analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing information, and critiquing strengths and weaknesses.

layer16_fid18957,Use and explanation of negative numbers,"This feature activates on mathematical and technical text that explicitly uses negative numbers or signs (−) and often explains their meaning, manipulation, or consequences in calculations, coordinates, or formulas. It appears across algebra, trigonometry, programming, signal processing, and measurement contexts where negativity or sign changes are central to the explanation.",none,none,"Many snippets focus on negative numeric values or sign changes: rational numbers with negatives like −6.6 [0], prefix/postfix and unary minus in code (b = -a) [1], negative percentage change −50% [2], algebraic expressions yielding negative fractions [3], solving for y with negative coefficients and negative results [4], frequency arrays including negative indices [5], negative temperatures (−218.79 °C, −361.82 °F, etc.) [6], negative Fahrenheit/Celsius ranges [7], reasoning about x and y both negative in quadrant III [8], reflections involving negative inputs/outputs f(−x), −f(x) and discussion of negatives under radicals [9], chord notation using minus sign for minor (E-, A-) [10], and quadratic roots including a negative solution −3 [11].

Several also include boilerplate review prompts like “Be the first to write a review” or “There aren't any reviews yet. Be the first to review this title.” or “Unrated ( Be the first to review this item )” in [4], [6], [9], and [11].

Even the Hebrew word for agency is presented in a definitional way, linking the term to a specific institution [0]. The common pattern is explanatory definition rather than any clear moral foundation.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.79
layer20_fid116321,Expository or academic-style informational writing,"This feature activates on expository, informational, or academic-style prose that explains concepts, reports findings, or analyzes texts in a structured, formal manner. The snippets typically describe studies, analyses, plans, medical explanations, or historical/political events rather than narratives or dialogue.",none,none,"Most snippets are formal, informational passages: scientific reporting about gene-guided jaw development in zebrafish [1], an academic-style literary analysis of Steinbeck’s “The Chrysanthemums” [4], a definition and explanation of business records [5], a medical explanation of cirrhosis of the liver [6], a stakeholder management plan description [8], and a school report summarizing children’s academic activities [10]. Others similarly present structured information about media in the 21st century [2], puppy training framed as an instructional guide [3], and electoral reform in Quebec [11]. The commonality is expository, didactic writing rather than any clear moral foundation theme.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]",0.86
layer4_fid3594,Educational or reference-style informational prose,"This feature activates on expository, reference-like text that presents factual information in a neutral, instructional tone, often about science, medicine, nature, history, religion, or etymology. The snippets read like encyclopedia entries, research summaries, or educational articles aimed at informing the reader rather than persuading or narrating a story.",none,none,"Most snippets are neutral, didactic explanations: pharmacokinetic table data [0], a tree species description [1], an article on immune health and tea [2], a medical explainer on congenital heart defects [3], a description of an ice core lab [4], a research summary on cancers [5], an archival description of a wartime transport memo [6], a biographical/science-interest piece about snakes [7], a historical reflection on often-ignored faithful people [8], a conservation research report [9], a doctrinal/explanatory piece on the pronunciation of Yahweh’s name [10], and an etymological explanation of words like “dumb” and “dim” [11]. The commonality is expository, reference-style informational prose, not a specific moral theme.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.79
layer24_fid107631,"Numbered lists, outlines, and enumerated items","This feature activates on structured, explicitly numbered sequences such as lists, outlines, section headings, and ordered items (often using Arabic numerals with periods or dashes). It appears tied to expository or reference-style text that organizes information into enumerated points or subsections.",none,none,"Many snippets show clear use of numbered or enumerated structures: a vocabulary list of numbers [0], a timeline with years as ordered milestones [1], a sermon or study outline with numbered points [2], a country list with decimal-style numbering [10], and a step-like or itemized explanation in math instruction [5]. Parliamentary committees are also counted and referenced by specific numbers [8], and meteor shower timing is given with precise numeric dates and times [9]. These all suggest the feature is keyed to numeric enumeration and list-like organization rather than moral content.","[0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 910]",0.86
layer4_fid25453,"Section titles, headings, and document metadata","This feature activates on text that consists largely of document structure elements such as section or chapter titles, headings, labels, and brief metadata lists (e.g., contents pages, bullet-point property lists, or titled notes). It often appears where the text is organizing or categorizing information rather than presenting continuous prose narrative or argument.",none,none,"Snippet [0] is a table-of-contents style list of titled sections; [2] is a structured list of labeled attributes for a plant; [3] begins with a software title, release date, and copyright line; [4] and [5] have press-release style titled headings; [6] has a capitalized question-style heading; [8] starts with an imperative assignment-like heading; [10] has a bolded section title followed by an archival notice; and [11] has a labeled tactics/strategy heading and explanatory note. Across these, the common pattern is structural/organizational text elements rather than a specific moral theme, so no Moral Foundations category clearly applies.","[0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]",0.79
layer4_fid99882,Textual section endings and conclusions,"This feature activates on phrases and structures that explicitly signal the end of a section or text, such as chapter conclusions, summaries, and wrap‑ups (e.g., “To conclude this section,” “Concluding,” “So that’s it,” “To summarize”). It appears tied to rhetorical markers that close discussions or outline concluding parts of documents like research reports, proposals, and articles.",none,none,"Multiple snippets contain explicit conclusion or summary markers: formal chapter/section endings in academic or report structures (e.g., “CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS” [0], “RECOMMENDATIONS, IMPLICATIONS, AND CONCLUSION” [2], “summary, and conclusions” [3], “Conclusion” as a section heading [1], and proposal components including “Conclusion” [5]). Others use explicit concluding discourse markers in prose: “To conclude this section” [6], “Finally, we will wrap things up” [7], “So that’s it,” [8], “So that’s it, then.” [9], “Concluding, it has been underlined that…” [10], and “To summarize” [11]. These consistently indicate rhetorical closure rather than any specific moral content.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]",0.93
layer12_fid88330,Citation-heavy scientific or technical exposition,"This feature activates on expository passages that present scientific, medical, technical, or historical information and often include formal citations, dates, institutional names, or structured reference metadata. The style is informational and academic, frequently describing research, treatments, technologies, or historical entities rather than narrative or opinion.",none,none,"Many snippets are clearly academic or technical references: a formal medical citation with URL and access date [0], a historical infobox-style entry for an imperial abbey [1], a programming Q&A about URL structure [2], a scientific article introduction on RNA processing [3], a technical Java string-processing explanation [6], a global health/medical discussion of sleeping sickness priorities [5], an institutional press-style release on HPV vaccination [7], a genetics/biology article excerpt [8], a research news piece on stem cell treatments [9], a linguistic description of South African English [10], and a technical description of glass manufacturing processes [11]. The common pattern is structured, informational, often research- or institution-linked exposition, not a specific moral stance.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]",0.79
layer12_fid25501,Hagiographic or moral praise of virtuous women,"This feature activates on religious or moral narratives that honor women—especially saints, widows, or mothers—for their virtues, piety, and purposeful living. The text often contrasts their honored status with others and emphasizes exemplary conduct to be imitated.",sanctity,virtue,"Snippet [2] describes St. Matilda, explicitly identifying her as a saint and patroness, highlighting generosity to the Church and the poor, and her upbringing in a convent where she developed purposeful, virtuous habits—classic sanctity framing. Snippet [8] is a theological treatise on the honour of widows, explicitly linking them with virgins in terms of commendation and insisting they should not be left without honour, again elevating a specific group of women for their virtues and religiously framed moral status. Both passages use reverent, moralizing language to praise women’s holiness and exemplary behavior, fitting the Sanctity foundation on the virtue side.","[2, 8]",0.78
layer12_fid101290,Guidelines for effective academic/professional writing,"This feature activates on instructional text about how to write well-structured, clear, and effective essays, reports, reviews, and conclusions in academic or professional contexts. It emphasizes components like thesis statements, structure, research, analysis, grammar, and proper communication in writing tasks.",none,none,"Multiple snippets give prescriptive guidance on how to write or structure formal texts: report writing and professional written communication skills [0]; crafting a good thesis statement [1]; steps for writing study essays and media reviews [4]; and how to write strong conclusions and what a paper’s conclusion should contain [11]. These are all about writing quality and structure rather than moral content, so no Moral Foundations category clearly applies.","[0, 1, 4, 11]",0.9
