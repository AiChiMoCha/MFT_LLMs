layer24_fid3088,False,Biographical/institutional leadership and official roles,"This feature activates on biographical or institutional descriptions that highlight people in formal leadership or authoritative professional roles (president, professor, dean, head physician) and on official institutional designations. The pattern centers on structured, factual mentions of offices, appointments, and formally named institutions or titles rather than on moral evaluation of authority itself.",authority,none,"Snippets describe individuals in formal leadership or high-status professional roles: a university president praised as a leader and compared to Horace Mann and Abraham Lincoln [7], and a physician who was a professor, dean, and head physician at major institutions [8]. Another snippet lists an official state school with its formal name, designation date, and institutional role as a state primary school [11]. These are neutral, factual references to institutional authority and office-holding, aligning structurally with the Authority foundation but without clear virtue/vice valence.","[7, 8, 11]",0.78
layer28_fid114000,False,"Criminal justice, law enforcement, and legal process","This feature activates on discussions of criminal justice systems, including police work, courts, punishment, specific crimes, and related legal rights and procedures. It spans topics like sentencing, death penalty, hate-crime laws, perjury, investigative technology, and evaluations of law-enforcement practices and effectiveness.",authority,mixed,"Many snippets concern formal institutions that enforce rules—police, courts, prisons, and legal frameworks—such as predictive policing and probation officers [0], the role of a Minister of Justice and death penalty administration [1], ethical questions about officers’ press communications [2], Marines’ disciplinary ethos around punishment [3], hate-crime sentence enhancements [4], criminal liability for false statements and perjury [5], state regulation and intimidation of the press [6], gang violence and program effectiveness [7], a Justice of the Peace presiding over a famous hearing [8], crime statistics informing gun legislation [9], charging documents and probable cause hearings [10], and FBI/police use of facial recognition in investigations [11]. These all center on institutional authority, rule enforcement, and responses to rule-breaking, aligning best with the Authority foundation but in a descriptive, sometimes critical way, hence mixed polarity.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.86
layer4_fid65290,False,"Institutions, regulations, and formal responsibility","This feature activates on discussions of formal institutions (governments, corporations, agencies) and their structured responsibilities, policies, and standards, especially around regulation, compliance, and public-impact decisions. The text often explains how official bodies operate, support programs, or are blamed or praised for large-scale outcomes in finance, environment, science, or public ethics.",authority,mixed,"Many snippets center on governments or large organizations exercising or being critiqued for their formal authority: government climate policy and carbon pricing [2], overturning a ban on human–animal embryos via a new fertility bill [3], federal support for NASA/NSF education programs [8], and the designation of “Patriot Day” and competing conceptions of patriotism toward the state [9]. Others describe corporate or institutional responsibility frameworks and standards, such as corporate sustainability principles and value systems [6], GAAP accounting rules and expectations [7], and the role of big government in the credit crisis [10]. Even when not overtly moralized, these passages revolve around how recognized authorities set rules, make high-level decisions, or are held accountable, fitting the Authority foundation in a mixed way (both supportive and critical). Evidence about technical or environmental initiatives is framed through institutional actors (companies, government, utilities), reinforcing the institutional/authority focus [0],[1],[4],[5],[11].","[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]",0.79
layer4_fid43421,False,References to “The Government …” as actor/subject,"This feature activates on expository or news-style sentences that begin with or prominently feature the phrase “The Government …” or “The Government of …”, treating government as the main institutional actor in policy, initiatives, or decisions. It appears tied to formal descriptions of governmental actions, commitments, or programs across domains like climate, health, finance, and urban planning.",authority,mixed,"Most high-activation snippets explicitly start with “The government” or “The Government of …” and then describe official initiatives, policies, or reversals, indicating a pattern around institutional authority as an agent in formal prose [0–6]. These are not clearly praising or condemning authority but neutrally reporting or explaining its actions, so the moral valence is mixed. Other snippets without this pattern (e.g., [7], [9–11]) are likely low-activation or incidental, reinforcing that the core trigger is the governmental subject rather than general exposition.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.9
layer4_fid72227,False,Mentions of governments and national leaders,"This feature activates on references to formal political authorities, especially national governments and heads of state or government, often in explanatory or news-style contexts. It includes descriptions of government initiatives, policies, and actions, as well as general information about presidents and their roles.",authority,mixed,"All snippets prominently begin with or emphasize institutional political actors: “The government’s former climate-change adviser” [0], “The government has overturned its proposed ban” [1], “The Government has given the Reserve Bank…” [3], “The Government’s initiative to develop 100 cities…” [4], “The Government of India's initiative…” [5], “The Government of Malaysia is committed…” [6], and “The Government of Jersey…” [7]. Others focus on presidents as national leaders: “The presidents of the United States…” [2], “The president, a man of color, was elected twice…” [9], “The president of the Republic of Kosovo… is the head of state and chief representative…” [10], and “President Kennedy signs a proclamation…” [11]. Snippet [8] features a Congressman addressing a governmental policy decision. The common thread is discussion of formal political authority and its actions, aligning with the Authority foundation but without a clear positive or negative moral valence overall.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.93
layer28_fid17185,False,Medical explanations of injuries and health risks,"This feature activates for expository medical or safety content that explains injuries, diseases, or health risks, often including causes, severity ranges, statistics, and the importance of prevention or proper treatment. The text typically focuses on physical harm (fractures, sprains, chronic illness, infections, abuse) and communicates their seriousness and potential consequences for well-being.",care,virtue,"Many snippets describe physical harm and how to prevent, treat, or understand it: ankle fractures and their severity [0], autoimmune disease and tissue damage [1], food allergies and treatment trials [2], serious injuries from falls in older adults with statistics [3], workshop safety to avoid injury [4], explanation of type 2 diabetes and its bodily impact [5], playground injuries and prevention for children [6], wrist sprains and the need for timely medical care [7], antibiotic resistance leading to worse outcomes and death [8], dehydration risks in dogs [9], hearing loss and its prevention for musicians [10], and shaken baby syndrome with severe consequences and mortality [11]. All center on concern for health, injury prevention, and reducing suffering, aligning with the Care/harm foundation in a protective, informational way.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.9
layer24_fid69927,False,"Low-calorie, nutrient-dense healthy food descriptions","This feature activates on expository descriptions of foods that are low in calories yet rich in nutrients, often framed as healthy choices for weight control or overall diet quality. The text typically highlights calorie content, fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and associated health or weight-loss benefits, sometimes within broader diet-guidance contexts.",care,virtue,"Multiple snippets explicitly emphasize foods that are low in calories but high in nutrients and health benefits, often in the context of supporting weight loss or a healthy diet, which aligns with promoting physical well-being (care as a virtue). Examples include dehydrated pineapple as low-calorie and nutrient-rich [2], fruits and vegetables being low in calories and aiding weight reduction [3], vegetables being low in fat and calories and recommended by health organizations [4], watercress as low-calorie and nutrient-dense with many health benefits [6], guidance on measuring servings to limit calories for weight loss or special health diets [7], and blueberries being low in calories and fat but high in fiber and antioxidants [10]. These all center on caring for health through dietary choices.","[2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10]",0.86
layer16_fid130669,False,"Condemning bullying, coercion, and abusive mistreatment","This feature activates for discussions that define, condemn, or seek to prevent bullying, coercion, hate crimes, racism, and other forms of abusive mistreatment, often emphasizing victims’ rights, safety, and respect. The text typically frames such behaviors as unacceptable, harmful, or illegal and may include policies, definitions, or moral appeals to protect vulnerable people.",care,virtue,"Many snippets explicitly denounce bullying and promote kindness, respect, and protection of students or workers from harm, which aligns with the Care/harm foundation (e.g., anti-bullying policies and reminders to behave kindly and not hurt others) [0,4,6,7]. Others condemn hate crimes, racism, torture, coercion, and forced marriage as violations of rights and as harmful, abusive behaviors, again centering on preventing suffering and protecting victims [1,2,3,8,10]. Even where legal or definitional language is used (e.g., coercion, fraud vs theft), the framing is that these are wrongful acts that harm others and should be guarded against [8,9].","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]",0.93
layer28_fid118156,False,Harms and risk factors to health or systems,"This feature activates on descriptions of harmful or damaging agents and conditions—such as pollutants, toxins, noise, stress, humidity, or invasive species—and their negative effects on health, the body, or functional systems. The text often explains how these factors cause injury, illness, degradation, or other adverse outcomes and sometimes mentions prevention or mitigation thresholds.",care,vice,"Many snippets explicitly discuss harmful exposures and their detrimental effects: pesticides as substances used against pests but with implied toxicity [0], radon building up to dangerous levels in homes [1], coal pollution producing profoundly harmful environmental and public health impacts [3], hazardous workplace noise causing permanent and preventable hearing loss [4], stress harming physical health and impeding happiness [5], humidity causing irreversible damage to hearing aids [6], lack of good bacteria leading to serious illness [7], a dam and invasive fish being very damaging to a lake ecosystem [8], contaminants in drinking water that are known or suspected to be harmful [9], sugar being as bad for the body and skin as smoking and sun [10], and stress in a course leading to negative cognitive outcomes [11]. These all center on risk, damage, and harm, aligning with the Care/harm foundation on the vice (harm) side.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]",0.86
layer28_fid47018,False,Catastrophic disasters and apocalyptic upheavals,"This feature activates for vivid descriptions of catastrophic or apocalyptic events—natural, technological, or supernatural—emphasizing massive destruction, terror, and world-shaking upheaval. It includes volcanic eruptions, nuclear accidents, tsunamis, industrial fires, and religiously framed cosmic disturbances that disrupt normal life on a grand scale.",care,vice,"Most snippets describe large-scale disasters causing or threatening extreme harm to many people: volcanic eruptions like Krakatoa [2][4], nuclear accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima [9][10][11], a deadly factory fire [7], and tsunami impacts [10][11]. Others frame cosmic or religious upheaval with violent natural reactions to sacred events [0][6] or terrifying scenarios of armed police and panic [3]. Even when not explicitly listing casualties, the language centers on overwhelming destructive force, fear, and suffering, aligning with the harm side of the care foundation. The dragon/monster imagery [1] and prophetic ‘fatidical fury’ [5] also contribute to an apocalyptic or ominous tone rather than ordinary description.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]",0.86
layer28_fid54738,False,Natural disasters and their destructive impact,"This feature activates for mentions of natural disasters—especially earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and similar events—and their damaging or disruptive effects on people, buildings, and communities, sometimes including recovery or risk-mitigation efforts. It spans both concrete physical destruction (collapsed or damaged structures) and broader human consequences such as trauma, emergencies, and the need for aid or insurance.",care,mixed,"Many snippets explicitly reference natural disasters and their harmful consequences: PTSD from traumatic events including natural disasters [1]; social media helping people during floods [4]; insurance to ease financial burdens from disasters like floods and earthquakes [6]; descriptions of catastrophic floods in Pakistan and their human impact [8]; emergencies affecting children’s well-being due to floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes [9]. Others describe structural damage and reconstruction after earthquakes or collapses [0,3,5,10,11], and flood/earthquake dating of historical scenes [2]. These all center on harm from disasters and responses to mitigate or recover from that harm, aligning with the Care/harm foundation but in a largely descriptive, informational way rather than purely moral praise or blame.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.9
layer28_fid85517,False,Definitions and examples of empathy/compassion,"This feature activates on explanatory or didactic text that defines empathy, sympathy, or compassion and often contrasts them, usually in the context of responding to others’ suffering or distress, sometimes with religious or philosophical framing. It highlights descriptions of understanding others’ feelings and the motivation to relieve suffering, rather than on suffering itself.",care,virtue,"Several snippets explicitly define empathy and sympathy as understanding or sharing others’ feelings and responding to distress (e.g., [0], [3], [9]). Compassion is described as sympathetic consciousness of others’ distress plus a desire to relieve it, along with related traits like sensitivity and non-judgment [3]. Other snippets frame religious or spiritual practices around recognizing and alleviating suffering, such as Buddhism’s focus on overcoming negative states of mind and cultivating love and compassion [1], Queen Esther’s compassion and willingness to risk herself to relieve Mordecai’s distress [2], and Ramadan fasting as a reminder of the suffering of the less fortunate and a prompt to charity and feeding the hungry [10]. These all align with the Care/harm foundation on the virtue side, emphasizing concern for others’ suffering and the wish to help.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10]",0.93
layer12_fid129124,False,Awareness campaigns about health and risk issues,"This feature activates for informational or advocacy text that raises awareness about health conditions, environmental or occupational risks, and the need for prevention, early intervention, or protective action. The snippets often describe vulnerable groups, potential harms, and organized efforts (weeks, days, campaigns) to inform and protect people.",care,virtue,"Many snippets focus on preventing or mitigating harm to people’s health or wellbeing: rare diseases and their impact [0], neuropathy and the need for early intervention and research [1], mental health awareness and promoting good mental health for all [5], climate change impacts on vulnerable communities and ecosystems [6], and advice to avoid heat-related illness and stay hydrated [8]. These are framed as protective, caring efforts (awareness weeks, campaigns, guidance) aimed at reducing suffering and risk, aligning with the Care foundation on the virtue side. Other snippets are more neutral/expository but still informational, yet the strongest pattern is health- and risk-related awareness and protection.","[0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]",0.86
layer4_fid123373,False,"Business and corporate practices, duties, and impacts","This feature activates on expository discussion of business and corporate activity, especially where companies’ responsibilities, practices, and impacts on society or the environment are described or evaluated. It often appears in contexts about corporate sustainability, ethical obligations, environmental footprints, and access to essential resources.",fairness,virtue,"Many snippets are neutral business/marketing descriptions, but several explicitly frame corporate behavior in terms of responsibilities and doing their part for broader societal or environmental good. Snippet [5] discusses corporate sustainability as meeting fundamental responsibilities in human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption, which aligns with fairness/justice norms. Snippet [7] talks about companies reducing carbon footprints and becoming part of the environmental solution rather than adding to the problem, implying fair treatment of shared environmental resources and future stakeholders. Snippet [9] highlights companies helping millions access clean water, emphasizing equitable access to a basic resource and reduction of disease and death, again mapping to fairness and justice. Other business-focused snippets ([2], [4], [6], [8], [10], [11]) support that the feature is keyed to corporate/business contexts, with [11] touching on environmental harm from economic activity, which also has a fairness dimension regarding shared natural assets.","[2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]",0.78
layer28_fid70504,False,Grim statistics on large-scale human suffering,"This feature activates on passages that present stark, often numerical descriptions of widespread human suffering or crisis—especially involving children, violence, disease, or displacement—framed as disturbing, bleak, or devastating. The rhetoric combines quantitative data with emotionally charged language to emphasize the severity and tragic nature of the situation.",care,virtue,"Many snippets enumerate victims and deaths with phrases like “grim reading,” “devastating impact,” “disturbing,” “bleak picture,” and “staggering,” highlighting concern for human welfare and vulnerability. Examples include refugees and displaced people [0], rape and stalking victims [1], school shootings [2], severe untreated health problems [3], migrant children in detention [4], child sexual abuse imagery [5], an HIV/AIDS health crisis [6], children in toxic environments [7], drowning deaths [8], and deaths from unsafe water [10]. These all foreground harm, especially to children, and implicitly appeal to compassion and protection, aligning with the Care/harm foundation in a virtue-oriented way (drawing attention to suffering to motivate concern). Evidence [11] similarly lists bombing casualties in a somber frame, reinforcing the pattern of grim casualty statistics.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.86
