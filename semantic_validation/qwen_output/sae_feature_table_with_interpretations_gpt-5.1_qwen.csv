layer4_fid34088,False,Expository definition of a concept or institution,"This feature activates for expository passages that introduce and define a concept, system, or institution—often with headings like “The concept of…” or section markers such as “II.” followed by an explanation of origins, roles, or mechanisms. The style is formal and informational, frequently describing governmental, political, technical, or scientific structures and how they function.",none,none,"Many snippets explicitly begin with “The concept of …” and then define or explain that concept in a formal, textbook-like manner (e.g., welfare state, economic planning, retirement, aplastic anemia, design in education, electro simulation device) [4,5,6,7,8,9]. Others are sectioned expository explanations of institutional or systemic topics such as congestion pricing, regional autonomy for ethnic minorities, camouflage directorates, and military officer education [0,1,3,11].

layer24_fid130444,False,Use of graded intensity/severity categories,"This feature activates on texts that classify things into ordered levels of intensity or severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe; light, moderate, vigorous; pass, merit, distinction) and explain or apply those gradations. It often appears in technical or educational contexts where criteria or conditions are described along a spectrum of strength or seriousness.",none,none,"Many snippets explicitly use and explain tiered categories such as mild/moderate/severe or beginner/advanced/expert or pass/merit/distinction: hearing loss severity levels [4], hemophilia severity (mild, moderate, life‑threatening) [6], intellectual disability often mild to moderate but can be severe [7], exercise intensity light/moderate/vigorous [9], competence levels beginner/advanced/expert [5], and effect size small/moderate/large [11]. Snippet [8] similarly discusses three levels of pass (Pass, Merit, Distinction). Snippet [1] contrasts removing all stress vs adding some pressure, again implying degree.

layer28_fid102768,False,Historical or scientific explanatory exposition,"This feature activates on neutral, expository prose that explains historical events, scientific or medical mechanisms, or doctrinal background in an informative tone. The snippets typically provide contextual details, causes, or definitions rather than argument or narrative, across topics like religion, history, physics, and health.",none,none,"Many snippets are encyclopedic or textbook-style explanations: medical/biological processes [0],[7],[11], scientific descriptions [2],[3],[10], and historical or religious background expositions [4],[6],[8],[9].

layer20_fid125220,False,Explanatory headings with colon and subtitle,"This feature activates on titles or section headers that begin with a key term or phrase and then use a colon to introduce an explanatory or elaborating subtitle, often in informational or academic-style text. The pattern is structural and rhetorical rather than topical, marking labeled sections like “Accessing IoT Device Secrets: Dumping Data from an SPI Flash Memory” or “Walpurgis Night: A Saint, Witches, and Pagan Beliefs…”.",none,none,"Several snippets show a consistent formatting pattern where a main heading or term is followed by a colon and an explanatory subtitle. For example, “Walpurgis Night: A Saint, Witches, and Pagan Beliefs in a Springtime Halloween for Scandinavia” clearly uses this structure [3]. Similarly, “Access to documents related to crimes against international law in the possesion of Serbian institutions: State Secret Prevails over Right to the Truth” [9] and “Accessing IoT Device Secrets

Dumping Data from an SPI Flash Memory” (a heading plus explanatory line functioning like a subtitle) [11] fit the same rhetorical pattern. The content topics vary widely (religion, law, cybersecurity), indicating the feature is keyed to the stylistic/structural form rather than any specific moral or thematic domain, so no Moral Foundations category is appropriate.","[3, 9, 11]",0.79

It includes references to diagnostic or summative assessments, reading/listening comprehension, worksheets, and efforts to improve public education systems.",none,none,"Several snippets focus on classroom practice and assessment: reading comprehension questions and worksheets [1], diagnostic and summative listening/reading/speaking/writing assessments [9], and discussion of language acquisition and communication skills in learning contexts [6]. Another snippet describes an initiative to improve public schooling and strengthen teaching techniques and liberal arts understanding [5]. These collectively indicate a feature keyed to educational methods, assessments, and materials rather than a moral stance, so no specific Moral Foundations category is appropriate.","[1, 5, 6, 9]",0.78
layer24_fid27957,False,Describing ordered stages or segments in sequences,"This feature activates on text that divides a process, story, game, or set of items into ordered stages or tiers (e.g., beginning/middle/end; low/medium/high; upper/middle/lower) and explains their roles or differences. The pattern is expository descriptions that segment a continuum or hierarchy into labeled parts and often compare their functions or characteristics.",none,none,"Many snippets explicitly partition something into three ordered segments: beginning, middle, and end of recess or stories [4,6,8,9,10]; opening, middle game, and end game in chess [8]; upper, middle, and lower bands of a people [5]; outer, middle, and inner ear [3]; low-, medium-, and high-output wind generators [1] and low-, medium-, and high-cost shoes [7]; bifocals, trifocals, and progressives for different distances [2]; and short-, medium-, and long-term goals [11].

Others describe corporate or institutional responsibility frameworks and standards, such as corporate sustainability principles and value systems [6], GAAP accounting rules and expectations [7], and the role of big government in the credit crisis [10]. Even when not overtly moralized, these passages revolve around how recognized authorities set rules, make high-level decisions, or are held accountable, fitting the Authority foundation in a mixed way (both supportive and critical).

It spans topics from health and economics to education and technical science descriptions, unified by their didactic, concept-explaining function rather than subject matter.",none,none,"Many snippets explicitly define terms or concepts: “What is Self Empowerment?” with a definition that follows [3], “By definition, they are a schematic…” for concept maps [6], and “Concept 5 inflation what is inflation inflation means…” [9]. Others foreground explanatory relationships with formulaic openings like “The link between diabetes and all forms of dementia…” [4], “The link between STDs and HIV” [10], and “The link between diet and health is important…” [11]. Several use “Concept” in a pedagogical or descriptive sense, such as “Concept illustration of a grism image” explaining what a grism is [7] and “Concept-Centered Teaching’s Full Profile” describing an educational approach [8]. Even historically or institutionally focused snippets maintain an expository, descriptive tone about people, places, or organizations [0][1][2][5].

layer16_fid121857,False,Expository section headings beginning with “The”,"This feature activates on formal, expository-style section titles or headings that begin with the word “The” and introduce a topic, impact, limits, or definition in an academic or journalistic register. The snippets are typically standalone heading lines or opening sentences that function as labeled sections in reports, articles, or essays.",none,none,"All snippets start with “The” followed by a noun phrase that serves as a section or article title, often with a colon and subtitle (e.g., “The Limits and Freedoms of Literary Regionalism…”, “The impact of climate change and urban growth on urban climate…”), or a clearly expository heading (“The beginning of camouflage in World War II”, “The announcement of a newly confirmed exoplanet…”). They share a formal, informational tone and structural role as headings or lead sentences rather than any clear moral content, so no Moral Foundations category is appropriate.

layer8_fid44118,False,Sentences beginning with ‘The’ + abstract noun,"This feature activates on sentences that start with the phrase “The” followed by an abstract or institutional noun (e.g., government, information, findings, government’s), typically introducing an explanation, report, or description. The snippets often serve as expository openings that frame a topic or summarize official or research-based content.",none,none,"All snippets begin with “The” plus a noun phrase functioning as a topic introducer: “The beginning of camouflage…”, “The government’s former climate-change adviser…”, “The government has overturned…”, “The information in this article…”, “The information behind the decision…”, “The information on this page…”, “The announcement of a newly confirmed exoplanet…”, “The findings…”, “The findings were published…”, “The findings showed…”, “The Government has given…”, “The Government’s initiative…”.

layer20_fid22236,False,Academic-style titles on impacts and effects,"This feature activates for academic or expository phrases that introduce topics using formulaic title-like constructions beginning with “The impact of …” or “The effects of …”, typically in research, essay, or report contexts. It reflects a neutral, informational framing of consequences or influence on a subject rather than any specific moral stance.",none,none,"All snippets are headed by nearly identical constructions such as “The impact of …” [0–8] and “The effects of …” [9–11], often clearly functioning as titles or section headers for academic papers, essays, or explanatory articles. The content domains vary widely—from camouflage in WWII [0] to climate change [2,4,10], PR [3], video games [5], traumatic death [6], ebooks and environment [7], organizational culture [8], inflation [9], and air pollution [11]—indicating the feature is keyed to the rhetorical/title pattern rather than any specific topic or moral theme.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.93
layer12_fid105372,False,Section headings beginning with Roman numeral II,"This feature activates on section or chapter titles that begin with the Roman numeral ""II"" followed by a period or space, often introducing a new major section of a document. It appears tied to the structural pattern of labeled subsections rather than any specific topic or moral content.",none,none,"Several snippets clearly show section headings starting with ""II"" (e.g., ""II. WHAT IS CONGESTION PRICING?"", ""II. The Political Status..."", ""II Through the Looking-Glass""), indicating the feature is keyed to this formatting/structural pattern rather than semantics or morality. Other snippets beginning with different words like ""Ensure"", ""Come"", or proper nouns do not share a strong semantic theme, reinforcing that the consistent trigger is the Roman numeral section label.

layer12_fid98536,False,Explanatory definition of key concept or term,"This feature activates on passages that introduce and define a central concept or question, often beginning with phrases like “What is…?” or “The simple answer is…,” and then providing a concise explanatory overview. The style is didactic and expository, aiming to clarify a term, mechanism, or policy for the reader.",none,none,"Several snippets explicitly introduce and define a focal concept: congestion pricing is defined and briefly explained as a policy tool [0]; regional autonomy for ethnic minorities is introduced as a constitutional system and political status [1]; the quote in [2] frames an explanation of nature’s order and understanding; [7] introduces 741 op-amp circuit design ideas in an explanatory, tutorial tone; [8] starts with “The simple answer is yes” and then explains risks of sunlight to eyes; [10] defines aldosterone and its regulatory role; [11] introduces and conceptualizes a ‘fat tax’.

Bush [10], and K. C. George [11]. The pattern is not moral but nominal and stylistic: informational text centered on a person named George. Eleanor Roosevelt [0], the camouflage unit [1], and MRI [2] are similar in expository tone, reinforcing that this is about encyclopedic/biographical exposition rather than moral content.","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",0.86

The content spans diverse domains (economics, environment, education, management, memorial design) but consistently focuses on explaining or outlining a conceptual framework rather than narrating events or giving opinions.",none,none,"Across snippets, the recurring pattern is the explicit framing of a subject as a concept to be defined or elaborated: “Conceptualizing the 'Fat Tax'” [0], “Concepts of Environmental Management for Sustainable Development” [1], “Concept-Centered Teaching's Full Profile” [2], “Concept illustration of a grism image” [3], “Concept 5 inflation what is inflation” [4], “Concept map templates” [5], “Concepts of Meaning” [6], “Concept by: Tatiana Speri” for a course [7], “Concept of essay about customs” [8], “Concept of management by objectives approach” [9], “Concept of the Memorial Complex in Auschwitz II-Birkenau” [10], and “Concept on Bamboo Industry Development in Mindanao” [11].
